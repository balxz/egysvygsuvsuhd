🚨 ALERT – Hidden Spyware in a Popular App! 🚨

Friends and professional network, take the time to read this. It’s essential for your digital security! 📲

You might have seen advertisements for the Temu app. Currently, this app is trending at the top in the "Shopping" category.

Temu is the international version of Pinduoduo, a hugely popular shopping app in China. Despite its appealing offers, it's URGENT to be cautious. Why? It contains spyware!

🔍 During your shopping sessions, Temu discreetly collects a multitude of your data: browsing preferences, cookies, messages, notifications, and even your bank details.

According to a recent report by American company Grizzly Research, Temu constitutes an "urgent security threat" to the national interests of the United States. They have highlighted inappropriate and dangerous software functions for a shopping app.

Even more surprisingly, despite its popularity, Temu is not profitable. Advertising expenses and shipping costs are enormous. This raises a question: is the company monetizing our data? 🤔

I strongly encourage you to avoid this application and to alert your loved ones. Remember, your digital security is paramount!
