Bonjour à tous,

I am Cédric THIERRY from the OxyaOne team, and we are honored to have won the innovation prize at this edition of Les Entrep' Bourgogne.

Participating in this journey has been an incredibly enriching experience for us. It allowed us to explore many aspects of entrepreneurship that we had not anticipated. It was a true revelation and a unique opportunity to learn and grow as young entrepreneurs.

I want to warmly thank the teams at Réseau Entreprendre Bourgogne and all the stakeholders involved in setting up the workshops. Your commitment, expertise, and kindness were invaluable throughout this journey.

A special thanks to our coach, Anne-Cecile Colin, whose unwavering support, insightful advice, and availability were crucial to our success. Thank you immensely for your guidance.

Lastly, I congratulate all the participants and winners of this edition. The projects presented were all inspiring and promising. I wish us all great success in our entrepreneurial ventures.

Thank you to Michel Girard for presenting us with this magnificent opportunity.

Cédric THIERRY
Team OxyaOne
